# advent-of-code-2024
my (sometimes very ugly and very stupid) solutions to advent of code 2024.

most of these solutions are pretty bad. i switched from using c++ to python for advent of code because i got tired of writing a lot of code when i could write a little code. 

i mostly solve these puzzles with the end goal in mind rather than finding the cleverest algorithm/solution for it. sometimes that means slow algos (i think one of my solution was 20 seconds... lol) but if i can get the puzzle answer without spending minutes or hours running a program, it's good enough for me. i'm (obviously) not gunning for leaderboard positions.

however, if my solutions are slow, sometimes i spend some extra time trying to make them a little faster (for example, day 18 part 2 took my code solution ~7s, but i figured out i could make it a little faster after some time (*cough* like 2 days later *cough*) by doing a binary search.
